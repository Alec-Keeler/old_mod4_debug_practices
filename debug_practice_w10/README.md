Test your debugging skills

There are numerous bugs throughout this code.

You have found all of the bugs if you can:

Run
```
npm run cleanSlate
```
without errors (this is a custom script you can find in the package.json)

Run
```
node query_1.js
```
and see the expected result printed to your terminal

Run
```
node query_2.js
```
and see the expected result printed to your terminal

You will not need to generate any new files.  You will need to create the expected user in your local postgres.  You will need to run npm install.
